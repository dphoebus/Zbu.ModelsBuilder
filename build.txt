MISC
----

Configurations "Debug-U6" and "Release-U6" are for Umbraco v6.
  Both define compile constant UMBRACO_6
  Which is used in Zbu.ModelsBuilder.AspNet.ModelsBuilderAuthFilter

Umbraco dependencies
  The following libs must be in lib/umbraco:
    businesslogic.dll
	interfaces.dll
	newtonsoft.Json.dll
	Umbraco.Core.dll
	umbraco.dll

  In order to build for v6 the same libs must be in lib/umbraco-v6
  These are conditional references in csproj files

Packages (NuGet, Umbraco, Vsix...) are created for "Release" build only,
in the build directory.

NOTES
  SharpZipLib in lib is there for MSBuild.Umbraco.Tasks
    Could not get it to use the one in the nuget package
    See AspNet.csproj
  Newtonsoft.Json
    Using the one that comes with Umbraco not a package
	because of version issues
